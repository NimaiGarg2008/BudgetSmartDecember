		<p id = "preface-text">
			You are Alex, a young teen who lives in a neighborhood with your hardworking mom. When you start driving,
			one day, your mom asks you to take on an important task: buy the week's groceries--but with a catch: you only
			can spend your allowance, since your mom doesn't have enough.

			Your mission is clear: Get the essentials for this week without going over the budget. Your mom has a list of
			items she needs which you grab and put in your pocket. You'll have to figure out how to balance everything in
			your shopping cart, while ensuring your mom is satisified.
		</p> -->

		<h1 id = "goal"> <u> Goal </u></h1>
		<p id = "instruction-text">
			You will be running some errands at a grocery store. In each session, you will be given a set, 
			randomized budget, as well as a set, randomized list. Your goal is to get all the basic products
			listed on the shopping list while not straying too far from the budget you've been given. <br></br> Along
			with this, every item in the store has a "desirability" meter, and getting items with higher
			desirability while keeping reasonably within the set budget will give you higher points.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id = "controls"><u> Controls </u></h2>
		<p id = "controls-text">
			Each item is shown with two buttons below it - an "Add To Cart" button, and a "Remove" 
			button. Use these to take or put back items. Every time you click one of these two buttons, the
			remaining budget is adjusted accordingly.
			<br></br>
			Use left and right arrow keys in the "Store Items" section to toggle back and forth between various
			items.			
			<br></br>
			At the bottom of the shopping page is a "Checkout" button. Click this when you are sure you have
			met the budget requirements and maximized the amount of points you can recieve via item desirability.
			If you over-exceed the budget or add items that aren't on the list, you will be asked to try again or
			put some items back.
			<br></br>
			With those basics out of the way, it's time to start shopping smarter!
